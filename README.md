This project is a simple quiz application implemented in Python. It consists of multiple components that work together to create and run a quiz, ask the user questions, and keep track of their score. The main components are:

1) Question Class (question_model): Defines a Question class with attributes for the question text and the correct answer.
2) Data: Contains the question_data list, which holds dictionaries of question text and their corresponding correct answers.
3) QuizBrain Class (quiz_brain): Manages the quiz logic, including presenting questions to the user, checking answers, and maintaining the score.
4) Main Script (main program): Initializes the quiz, iterates through the questions, and displays the final score to the user.
